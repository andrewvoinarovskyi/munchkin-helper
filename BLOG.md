This File existing only for my self-control, documentation and filnally for Me.
Below I will write my steps and notes that's intresting or/and important.
So You can ignore it if you don't interested in and STOP reading HERE :^).


Before start I need to check next rules:
1. First rule of (fighting club) munchkin helper: nobody should know about munchkin helper. 
2. [ ] - Before release (merge must probably into master brach), make sure you cleaned-up all things that's has affected to only previous version(-s).
3. [ ] - Check your MVP and roadmap before start new feature!
4. [ ] - Do you planned this your new feature or not? (If not, return to previous point and update Roadmap)
5. [ ] - Do you cover you code with tests?
6. [ ] - Don't forget about this file.
7. [ ] - If MVP ready for release, remove all things that was related on MVP (includes this point).


SIMPLE ROADMAP:


FIRST INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES:
1. VSCode - Free IDE with unlimited potential.
2. GIT-bash - terminal with pretty-colored text.
3. Ruby v2.5.8 or later - backend PL as base for application.
4. Rails v6.x or v7.0.1+ - web server side framework based on Ruby.
5. HTML5 - for templates.
6. CSS3 - for good looking.
7. JavaScript v6+ - as frontend base.
8. Angular v13.x - framework based on JS for SPA.
9. (Optional) GIT-kraken - IDE for GIT.
10. (Optional) Asana or Jira - Task tracker.  
11. (Optional) Obsidian - Zettelcasten technique for documentation and mind.
12. etc.... dependencies I will not write down, 'cause they would saved into GEM file or somewhere else. 



FIRST STEPS:
1. I need to prepare simple roadmap and then find task tracker to check progress and docs.
2. With [videocourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg) I will setup simple RoR app. It is not important, but should help me with backend basics and create sceleton for simple updating my app to next versions.
3. Light cource about Angular for no reason.
4. Find Licence of Munchkin pics usage for one of final versions app
5. I think dependency deffects shouldn't create a problems, 'cause people would play and look themselves. This APP will only help you to play and follow game.
6. That's all for now, but I will fill up this while working.
7. 
8. Lucky me!
